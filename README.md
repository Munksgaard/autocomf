# AUTOCOMF - Automatic Configuration from Comments

**AUTOCOMF** is a programming language that presents a configuration UI
based on annotations in a source file.  The configuration specified
by the user is then incorporated by directly modifying the source
file.

**AUTOCOMF** can be added seamlessly to *any* programming language or
configuration language, since it is written exclusively within the
comment syntax of the host language.

**AUTOCOMF** has incorporates several attractive qualities:

* Self-modifying code.

* Semantically meaningful comments.

* ALL CAPS KEYWORDS.

* A human-friendly, intuitive, unclearly specified syntax.

* Named in honour of the universally loved
  [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) system.

**AUTOCOMF**

**AUTOCOMF** was developed as a contribution to [Langjam
